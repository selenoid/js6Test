Test

Please pre-execute a small test task using ES6 +.

Given a file with a lattice N x N (separators space and \ n),
 which is a minefield from the Minesweeper game. O - means that
 there is no mine on the field, X - that is. It is necessary to
 replace all O by the number of adjacent mines 
 (all adjacent cells 8 - horizontally, vertically and diagonally).

Example:

Input file:

X O O X X X O O
O O O O X O X X
X X O X X O O O
O X O O O X X X
O O X X X X O X
X O X X X O X O
O O O X O X O X
X O X X O X O X

Output to the console:

X 1 1 X X X 3 2
3 3 3 5 X 5 X X
X X 3 X X 5 5 4
3 X 5 5 6 X X X
2 4 X X X X 6 X
X 3 X X X 5 X 3
2 4 5 X 6 X 5 X
X 2 X X 4 X 4 X
